# Huang-Thresholding
A nice thresholding algorithm for bacterial colony isolation
Implements Huang's fuzzy thresholding method, recoded from the Java version from ImageJ.

Uses Shannon's entropy function, from *Huang L.-K. and Wang M.-J.J. (1995) "Image Thresholding by Minimizing the Measures of Fuzziness" Pattern Recognition, 28(1): 41-51*
